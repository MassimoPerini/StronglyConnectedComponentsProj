# Notes time functions

## Usage
Run to generate an example csv report:
```
./generate_report.sh
```

The matlab file `time_analysis.m` will generates several time duration plots.

We also fit a linear regression models to predict (e.g.) the duration time of Tarjan algorithm. In this way we can see that  R^2 and R^2_adj coefficients are close to 1, therefore the inputs fits well on a plane.
